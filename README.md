This repository contains two files

The file "NYC Homeless People Data" contains code that sorts the Department Services Data on individuals facing homelessness 
who are seeking resources form NYC homeless shelters. It uses the numpy, pandas, and matplotlib libraries to organize the data 
and display it graphically. 

The file "NYC Homeless People Data Relative to Jan 5 2020" contains a function to convert a file of the number of unsheltered 
homeless individuals in NYC to a list of unsheltered homeless individuals in NYC relative to January 5, 2020. This file uses the 
matplotlib library to plot the change in Department of Homeless Services data on homeless individuals seeking shelter relative to the
beginning of January 2020.
